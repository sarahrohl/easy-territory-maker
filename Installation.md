#Installation for absolute beginners
Easy Territory Maker is a simple project to setup, but does require php to render the output map, here is how to set it up

# Get PHP Server Running #
This sounds much more complicated than it sounds, for territory overseers download "xampp", which is a package of software that will allow you to get php running quickly.

  1. [Xampp Download Page](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) (Or any other php web server) It is recommended to go with the zipped version of xampp since ideally you won't be running a web server.
  1. Download easy territory maker source (more to come) using Subversion (command https://easy-territory-maker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk) in the html folder of Xampp
  1. Install bower, and run on the easy-territory-maker directory
  1. User Google Earth to make the Territory, save the KML file in folder "my\_folder" as "territory.kml"
  1. Put files into html sub folder called "easy-territory-maker"
  1. Start apache (which is the php server)
